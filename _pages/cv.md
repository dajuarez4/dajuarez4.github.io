Education
======

* **Ph.D. in Physics (Expected)**, *The University of Texas at El Paso*  
  **August 2025 – May 2030**

* **M.S. in Physics**, *The University of Texas at El Paso*  
  **August 2023 – May 2025**

* **B.S. in Physics (With Honors)**, *Autonomous University of Zacatecas*

Work Experience
======

* **Teaching Assistant**, *The University of Texas at El Paso*  
  **August 2023 – July 2024**  
  - Conducted two weekly lab sessions for Mechanics and Astronomy.  
  - In Mechanics: Taught principles of statics and dynamics, including Newton's laws, energy and momentum conservation, and oscillations.  
  - Supervised eleven practical experiments, guiding students through applying theoretical concepts and providing introductory explanations.  
  - In Astronomy: Introduced Kepler's Laws, orbital mechanics, exoplanets, celestial motion, and astronomical events through observation-based experiments and calculations.

* **Applied Mathematics & Computational Research Intern**, *Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory*  
  **July 2024 – August 2024**  
  - Worked on the project *"Ballistic Phonon Trajectories in Heat Distribution"*.  
  - Developed a robust pipeline to automate and execute thousands of simulations on Perlmutter.  
  - Analyzed phonon behavior and its impact on heat distribution.  
  - Implemented a framework to generate, run, and analyze classical molecular dynamics simulations for Nickel-Titanium alloys with point defects.

* **Research Assistant**, *The University of Texas at El Paso*  
  **January 2022 – May 2023**  
  - Mentored by Professor Jorge Muñoz.  
  - Developed and implemented computational tools to analyze large datasets.  
  - Extracted mechanical and thermodynamic properties from molecular dynamics and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.
